// What are Access Specifiers / Modifiers

// Access specifiers are keywords you use inside classes (or structs) to control visibility / accessibility of members (data members, member functions), nested types, etc.

// They help enforce encapsulation (hiding implementation details), data hiding, and to manage what derived classes get access to vs what outside code gets to see.

// Inheritance + Access Specifiers

// Access specifiers also interact with modes of inheritance (public, protected, private inheritance), which affect how base classâ€™s public/protected members behave in derived classes. This is a common area of interview questions.

// Other Rules and Special Cases

// To be interview-strong, you should know these subtleties:

// Friends

// A class can declare another function or class as a friend, so that friend has access to its private & protected members.

// Friend-ship is not inherited. If you make class A friend of B, derived classes of B do not automatically make A a friend of the derived.
