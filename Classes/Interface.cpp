// At its core, an interface defines a contract: a set of method signatures that any implementing class must fulfill. It declares what a class can do, but not how it does it.

// Consider a remote control. It exposes a standard set of buttons:

// play()
// pause()
// volumeUp()
// powerOff()
// The person using the remote doesnâ€™t care whether it controls a TV, a soundbar, or a projector. The interface remains the same, but the underlying device behaves differently.

// This is exactly how interfaces work in software design.


// An interface specifies what operations are expected, but not how they are carried out. This gives freedom to implementers to provide customized logic while still honoring the contract.

// Enables polymorphism
// Different classes can implement the same interface in different ways. This allows your code to work with different implementations interchangeably.

// Promotes decoupling
// Code that depends on interfaces is insulated from changes in concrete implementations. This reduces the ripple effect of changes and increases testability and maintainability.
